# Description   

This function displays *d* and non-central confidence interval for single *t* from means.

The formula for *d* is: $$d = \frac{t}{\sqrt(N)}$$
 
The formula for *t* is: $$t = \frac{M - \mu}{SE}$$

# R Function

d.single.t(m, u, sd, n, a = 0.05)

# Arguments 

+ m = sample mean
+ u	= population mean
+ sd = sample standard deviation
+ n = sample size
+ a = significance level


# Example  

A school has a gifted/honors program that they claim is significantly better than others in the country. The gifted/honors students in this school scored an average of 1370 on the SAT, while the national average for gifted programs is a SAT score of 1080. The data are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/doomlab/shiny-server/tree/master/MOTE/examples). Example output from JASP, SPSS, and SAS are shown below.

**SAS**

+ m = 1370
+ u	= 1080
+ sd = 112.7
+ n = 15
+ a = .05

# Function in R: 

d.single.t(m = 1370, u = 1080, sd = 112.7, n = 15, a = .05)

## Effect Size:

Effect Size: *d* = 2.57, 95% CI [1.49, 3.63]

## Interpretation: 

Your confidence interval does not include zero, and therefore, you might conclude that this effect size is different from zero.

## Summary Statistics: 

Not applicable.

## Test Statistic: 

 *t*(14) = 9.97, *p* < .001

## Interpretation: 

Your *p*-value is less than the alpha value, and therefore, this test would be considered statistically significant.
