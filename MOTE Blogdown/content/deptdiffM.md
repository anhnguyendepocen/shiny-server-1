# Description   

This function displays *d* for repeated measures data and the non-central confidence interval using the standard deviation of the differences as the denominator.

The formula for *d* is: $$d = {M\_{1} - M\_{2}\over SD\_{differences}}$$
 
The formula for *t* is: $$t = {M\_{1} - M\_{2}\over SE\_{differences}}$$

# R Function

d.dep.t.diff(mdiff, sddiff, n, a = 0.05)

# Arguments 

+ mdiff	= mean difference score
+ sddiff = standard deviation of the difference scores
+ n	= sample size
+ a	= significance level

# Example  

In a study to test the effects of science fiction movies on people's belief in the supernatural, seven people completed a measure of belief in the supernatural before and after watching a popular science fiction movie. Participants' scores are shown with high scores indicating high levels of belief. The data is included at [GitHub](https://github.com/doomlab/shiny-server/tree/master/MOTE/examples). Example output from JASP, SPSS, and SAS are shown below.

+ mdiff	= 1.143
+ sddiff = 2.116
+ n	= 14
+ a	= .05

# Function in R: 

d.dep.t.diff(mdiff = 1.143, sddiff = 2.116, n = 14, a = .05)

## Effect Size:

*d* = 0.54, 95% CI [-0.03, 1.09]

## Interpretation: 

Your confidence interval does include zero, and therefore, you might conclude that this effect size is similar to zero.

## Summary Statistics: 

*Mdiff* = 1.14, *SDdiff* = 2.12, *SE* = 0.57, 95% CI [-0.08, 2.36]

## Test Statistic: 

*t*(13) = 2.02, *p* = .064

## Interpretation: 

Your p-value is greater than the alpha value, and therefore, this test would be considered not statistically significant.
