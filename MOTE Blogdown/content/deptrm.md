# Description   

This function displays d for repeated measures data controlling for r and the non-central confidence interval using the average standard deviation of each level as the denominator.

The formula for *d* is: $$d = \frac{M_1 - M_2}{\frac{SD_1 + SD_2}{2}}$$

# R Function

d.dep.t.rm(m1, m2, sd1, sd2, r, n, a = 0.05)

# Arguments 

+ m1 = mean from first level
+ m2 = mean from second level
+ sd1	= standard deviation from first level
+ sd2	= standard deviation from second level
+ r	= correlation between first and second level
+ n	= sample size
+ a	= significance level

# Example  

In a study to test the effects of science fiction movies on people's belief in the supernatural, seven people completed a measure of belief in the supernatural before and after watching a popular science fiction movie. Participants' scores are shown with high scores indicating high levels of belief. The data is included at [GitHub](https://github.com/doomlab/shiny-server/tree/master/MOTE/examples). Example output from JASP, SPSS, and SAS are shown below.

+ m1 = 5.571
+ m2 = 4.429
+ sd1	= 1.988
+ sd2	= 2.878
+ r	= .678
+ n	= 7
+ a	= .05

# Function in R: 

d.dep.t.rm(m1 = 5.571, m2 = 4.429, sd1 = 1.988, sd2 = 2.878, r = .678, n = 7, a = .05)

## Effect Size:

*d* = 0.43, 95% CI [-0.68, 0.80]

## Interpretation: 

Your confidence interval does include zero, and therefore, you might conclude that this effect size is similar to zero.

## Summary Statistics: 

Group 1 Summary Statistics: *M* = 5.57, *SD* = 1.99, *SE* = 0.75, 95% CI [3.73, 7.41]

Group 2 Summary Statistics: *M* = 4.43, *SD* = 2.88, *SE* = 1.09, 95% CI [1.77, 7.09]

## Test Statistic: 

Not applicable. 

## Interpretation: 

Not applicable.
