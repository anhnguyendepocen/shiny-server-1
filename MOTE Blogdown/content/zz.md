# Description   

This function displays $d\_{z}$ for *Z*-tests based on the *Z*-statistic. The normal confidence interval is also provided if you have sigma ($\sigma$). If "sig" is left blank, then you will not see a confidence interval.

The formula for $d\_{z}$ is: $$d\_{z} = \frac{Z}{\sqrt(N)}$$
 
The formula for $d\_{z}$ is: $$d\_{z} = \frac{M - \mu}{\sigma_M}$$

# R Function

d.z.z(z, sig = NA, n, a = 0.05)

# Arguments 

+ z = statistic
+ sig	= population standard deviation
+ n	= sample size
+ a =	significance level 

# Example  

A recent study suggested that students (N = 100) learning statistics improved their test scores with the use of visual aids (*Z* = 2.5, *SD* = 4). 

# Function in R: 

d.z.z(z = 2.5, sig = 4, n = 100, a = .05)

# MOTE

## Effect Size:

Effect Size: $d\_{z}$ = 0.25, 95% CI [-7.59, 8.09]

## Interpretation: 

Your confidence interval does include zero, and therefore, you might conclude that this effect size is similar to zero.

## Summary Statistics: 

Not applicable.

## Test Statistic: 

*Z* = 2.50, *p* = .012

## Interpretation: 

Your *p*-value is less than the alpha value, and therefore, this test would be considered statistically significant.
