# Description   

This function displays omega squared from ANOVA analyses and its non-central confidence interval based on the F distribution. This formula is appropriate for multi-way between subjects designs.

The formula for $\omega\_p^2$ is: $$\frac{df\_{model} \times (MS\_{model} - MS\_{error})}{SS\_{model} + (N - df\_{model}) \times MS\_{error}}$$

The formula for *F* is: $$\frac{MS\_{model}}{MS\_{error}}$$

# R Function

omega.partial.SS.bn(dfm, dfe, msm, mse, ssm, n, a)

# Arguments 

+ dfm =	degrees of freedom for the model/IV/between
+ dfe	= degrees of freedom for the error/residual/within
+ msm	= mean square for the model/IV/between
+ mse	= mean square for the error/residual/within
+ ssm	= sum of squares for the model/IV/between
+ n	= total sample size
+ a	= significance level

# Example  

A health psychologist recorded the number of close inter-personal attachments of 45-year-olds who were in excellent, fair, or poor health. People in the Excellent Health group had 4, 3, 2, and 3 close attachments; people in the Fair Health group had 3, 5, and 8 close attachments; and people in the Poor Health group had 3, 1, 0, and 2 close attachments.

# Function in R: 

omega.partial.SS.bn(dfm = 1, dfe = 18250, msm = 1675682.823, mse = 33996.837, ssm = 1675682.823, n = 18260, a = 0.05)

## Effect Size:

$\omega\_p^2$ = .00, 95% CI [.00, .00]

## Interpretation: 

Your confidence interval does not include zero, and therefore, you might conclude that this effect size is different from zero.

## Summary Statistics: 

Not applicable.

## Test Statistic: 

F(1, 18250) = 49.29, p < .001

## Interpretation: 

Your p-value is less than the alpha value, and therefore, this test would be considered statistically significant.
