# Description   

This function displays omega squared from ANOVA analyses and its non-central confidence interval based on the F distribution. This formula is appropriate for multi-way between subjects designs.

The formula for $\omega\_p^2$ is: $$\frac{df\_{model} \times (MS\_{model} - MS\_{error})}{SS\_{model} + (N - df\_{model}) \times MS\_{error}}$$

The formula for *F* is: $$\frac{MS\_{model}}{MS\_{error}}$$

# R Function

omega.partial.SS.bn(dfm, dfe, msm, mse, ssm, n, a = 0.05)

# Arguments 


+ dfm =	degrees of freedom for the model/IV/between
+ dfe	= degrees of freedom for the error/residual/within
+ msm	= mean square for the model/IV/between
+ mse	= mean square for the error/residual/within
+ ssm	= sum of squares for the model/IV/between
+ n	= total sample size
+ a	= significance level
