# Description   

This function displays omega squared from ANOVA analyses and its non-central confidence interval based on the F distribution. These values are calculated directly from F statistics and can be used for between subjects and repeated measures designs. Remember if you have two or more IVs, these values are partial omega squared. 

The formula for $\omega\^2$ is: $$\frac{SS\_{model} - (df\_{model} \times MS\_{subject})} 
{SS\_{total} + SS\_{IV1} + J \times MS\_{subject}}$$

# R Function

 omega.F(dfm, dfe, Fvalue, n, a = 0.05) 

# Arguments 


+ dfm	= degrees of freedom for the model/IV/between
+ dfe	= degrees of freedom for the error/residual/within
+ Fvalue = F statistic
+ n	= full sample size
+ a	= significance level

# Example  

A health psychologist recorded the number of close inter-personal attachments of 45-year-olds who were in excellent, fair, or poor health. People in the Excellent Health group had 4, 3, 2, and 3 close attachments; people in the Fair Health group had 3, 5, and 8 close attachments; and people in the Poor Health group had 3, 1, 0, and 2 close attachments. The data is included at [GitHub](https://github.com/doomlab/shiny-server/tree/master/MOTE/examples). Example output from JASP, SPSS, and SAS are shown below.
