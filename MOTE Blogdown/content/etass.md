# Description   

The formula for $\eta^2$ is: $$\frac{SS\_{model}} {SS\_{total}}$$

# R Function

eta.full.SS(dfm, dfe, ssm, sst, Fvalue, a = 0.05)

# Arguments 

+ dfm = degrees of freedom for the model/IV/between   
+ dfe = degrees of freedom for the error/residual/within 
+ ssm = sum of squares for the model/IV/between
+ sst = sum of squares total
+ Fvalue = F statistic   
+ a	= significance level

# Example  

A health psychologist recorded the number of close inter-personal attachments of 45-year-olds who were in excellent, fair, or poor health. People in the Excellent Health group had 4, 3, 2, and 3 close attachments; people in the Fair Health group had 3, 5, and 8 close attachments; and people in the Poor Health group had 3, 1, 0, and 2 close attachments.

+ dfm = 2  
+ dfe = 8 
+ ssm = 25.24
+ sst = 44.91
+ Fvalue = 5.13   
+ a	= .05

# Function in R: 

eta.full.SS(dfm = 2, dfe = 8, ssm = 25.24, sst = 44.91, Fvalue = 5.13, a = 0.05)

## Effect Size:

$$\eta\^2$$ = .56, 95% CI [.00, .83]

## Interpretation: 

Your confidence interval does include zero, and therefore, you might conclude that this effect size is similar to zero.

## Summary Statistics: 

Not applicable. 

## Test Statistic: 

*F*(2, 8) = 5.13, *p* = .037

## Interpretation: 

Your *p*-value is less than the alpha value, and therefore, this test would be considered statistically significant.
