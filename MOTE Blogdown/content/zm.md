# Description   

This function displays $d\_{z}$ for *z*-test with the population mean and standard deviation. The normal confidence interval is also provided. 

The formula for $d\_{z}$ is: $$d = \frac{M - \mu}{\sigma}$$

The formula for *Z* is: $$Z = \frac{M - \mu}{\sigma_M}$$

# R Function

d.z.mean(mu, m1, sig, sd1, n, a = 0.05)

# Arguments 

+ mu = population mean  
+ m1 = sample study mean  
+ sig = population standard deviation  
+ sd1 = standard deviation from the study  
+ n = sample size  
+ a = significance level  

# Example  

The average quiz test taking time for a 10 item test is 22.5 minutes, with a standard deviation of 10 minutes. My class of 25 students took 19 minutes on the test with a standard deviation of 5. 

+ mu = 22.5  
+ m1 = 19
+ sig = 10  
+ sd1 = 5
+ n = 25
+ a = .05

# Function in R: 

d.z.mean(mu = 22.5, m1 = 19, sig = 10, sd1 = 5, n = 25, a = .05)

## Effect Size:

$d\_{z}$ = 2.50, 95% CI [-7.30, 12.30]

## Interpretation: 

Your confidence interval does include zero, and therefore, you might conclude that this effect size is similar to zero.

## Summary Statistics: 

*M* = 22.50, *SD* = 19.00, *SE* = 3.80, 95% CI [15.05, 29.95]

## Test Statistic: 

*Z* = 12.50, *p* < .001

## Interpretation: 

Your *p*-value is less than the alpha value, and therefore, this test would be considered statistically significant.
