# Description   

This function displays *V* and non-central confidence interval for the specified chi-square statistic.

The formula for *V* is: $$\sqrt{ \frac{\chi^2} {N \times df\_{smaller}} } $$

$df\_{smaller}$ is defined by the minimum of (rows - 1) or (columns - 1). 

# R Function

v.chi.sq(x2, n, r, c, a = 0.05) 

# Arguments 

+ x2 = chi-square statistic
+ n	= sample size
+ r	= number of rows in the contingency table
+ c	= number of columns in the contingency table
+ a	= significance level 

# Example  

Individuals were polled about their number of friends (low, medium, high) and their number of kids (1, 2, 3+) to determine if there was a relationship between friend groups and number of children, as we might expect that those with more children may have less time for friendship maintaining activities. The data are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/doomlab/shiny-server/tree/master/MOTE/examples). Example output from JASP, SPSS, and SAS are shown below.

# Function in R: 

v.chi.sq(x2 = 2.05, n = 60, r = 3, c = 3, a = 0.05)

## Effect Size:
This effect size is traditionally interpreted as the percent of variance accounted for in the DV by the IV(s).

*V* = .13, 95% CI [.18, .30]

## Interpretation: 

Your confidence interval does not include zero, and therefore, you might conclude that this effect size is different from zero.

## Summary Statistics: 

Not applicable.

## Test Statistic: 

$\chi\^2(4)$ = 2.05, p = .727

## Interpretation: 

Your *p*-value is greater than the alpha value, and therefore, this test would be considered not statistically significant.
