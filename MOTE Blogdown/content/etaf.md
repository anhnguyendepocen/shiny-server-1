# Description   

The formula for $\eta^{2}$ is: $${df\_{model} \times F\_{model}\over df\_{model} \times F\_{model} + df\_{error}}$$

This value will be $\eta^{2}$ when you use a one-way ANOVA and will be $\eta\_{p}^{2}$ when you use a multi-way ANOVA (more than one IV).

# R Function

eta.F(dfm, dfe, Fvalue, a = .05)

# Arguments 

+ dfm = degrees of freedom for the model/IV/between   
+ dfe = degrees of freedom for the error/residual/within   
+ Fvalue	= F statistic   
+ a	= significance level

# Example  

A health psychologist recorded the number of close inter-personal attachments of 45-year-olds who were in excellent, fair, or poor health. People in the Excellent Health group had 4, 3, 2, and 3 close attachments; people in the Fair Health group had 3, 5, and 8 close attachments; and people in the Poor Health group had 3, 1, 0, and 2 close attachments.

## Effect Size:

$\eta^2$ = .56, 95% CI [.00, .83]

## Interpretation: 

Your confidence interval does include zero, and therefore, you might conclude that this effect size is similar to zero.

## Summary Statistics: 

Not applicable. 

## Test Statistic: 

*F*(2, 8) = 5.13, *p* = .037

## Interpretation: 

Your p-value is less than the alpha value, and therefore, this test would be considered statistically significant.
