# Description   

This function displays $d_{av}$ for repeated measures data and the non-central confidence interval using the average standard deviation of each level as the denominator.

The formula for $d\_{av}$ is: $$d\_{av} = \frac{M_1 - M_2}{\frac{SD_1 + SD_2}{2}}$$

# R Function

d.dep.t.avg(m1, m2, sd1, sd2, n, a) 

# Arguments 

+ m1 = mean from first level
+ m2 = mean from second level
+ sd1 = standard deviation from first level
+ sd2	= standard deviation from second level
+ n = sample size
+ a	= significance level

# Example  

In a study to test the effects of science fiction movies on people's belief in the supernatural, seven people completed a measure of belief in the supernatural before and after watching a popular science fiction movie. Higher scores indicated high levels of belief. The mean measure of belief on the pretest was 5.57, while the posttest average score was lower, 4.43. The data is included at [GitHub](https://github.com/doomlab/shiny-server/tree/master/MOTE/examples). Example output from JASP, SPSS, and SAS are shown below.

# Example Arguments

+ m1 = 5.571
+ m2 = 4.429
+ sd1 = 1.988
+ sd2	= 2.878
+ n = 7
+ a	= .05

# Function in R: 

d.dep.t.avg(m1 = 5.571, m2 = 4.429, sd1 = 1.988, sd2 = 2.878, n = 7, a = .05)

## Effect Size:

$d\_{av}$ = 0.47, 95% CI [-0.33, 1.24]

## Interpretation: 

Your confidence interval does include zero, and therefore, you might conclude that this effect size is similar to zero.

## Summary Statistics: 

Group 1 Summary Statistics: *M* = 5.57, *SD* = 1.99, *SE* = 0.75, 95% CI [3.73,  7.41]

Group 2 Summary Statistics: *M* = 4.43, *SD* = 2.88, *SE* = 1.09, 95% CI [1.77, 7.09]

## Test Statistic: 

Not applicable.

## Interpretation: 

Not applicable.

## Sample Writeup:

The mean measure of belief on the pretest was 5.57, with a standard deviation of 1.99. The posttest scores appeared lower (M = 4.43, SD = 2.88) but the dependent t-test was not significant using alpha = .05,
*t(6)* = 1.43, *p* = .203, $d\_{av}$ = 0.47. The effect size was a medium effect suggesting that the movie may have influenced belief in the supernatural.
