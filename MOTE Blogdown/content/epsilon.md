# Description   

This function displays epsilon squared from ANOVA analyses and its non-central confidence interval based on the F distribution. This formula works for one way and multi way designs with careful focus on the sum of squares total calculation.

The formula for $\epsilon^2$ is: $$\frac{df\_{model} \times (MS\_{model} - MS\_{error})} {SS\_{total}}$$

The formula for *F* is: $$\frac{MS\_{model}}{MS\_{error}}$$

# R Function

epsilon.full.SS(dfm, dfe, msm, mse, sst, a = 0.05)

# Arguments 

+ dfm	= degrees of freedom for the model/IV/between
+ dfe	= degrees of freedom for the error/residual/within
+ msm = mean square for the model/IV/between
+ mse =	mean square for the error/residual/within
+ sst	= sum of squares total
+ a	= significance level

# Example  

A health psychologist recorded the number of close inter-personal attachments of 45-year-olds who were in excellent, fair, or poor health. People in the Excellent Health group had 4, 3, 2, and 3 close attachments; people in the Fair Health group had 3, 5, and 8 close attachments; and people in the Poor Health group had 3, 1, 0, and 2 close attachments.

+ dfe = 8 
+ msm = 12.621
+ mse = 2.458
+ sst = 44.909  
+ a	= .05

# Function in R: 

epsilon.full.SS(dfm = 2, dfe = 8, msm = 12.621, mse = 2.458, sst = 44.909, a)

## Effect Size:

$$\epsilon\^2$$ = .45, 95% CI [.00, .77]

## Interpretation: 

Your confidence interval does include zero, and therefore, you might conclude that this effect is similar to zero. 

## Summary Statistics: 

*F*(2, 8) = 5.13, *p* = .037

## Test Statistic: 

Not applicable. 

## Interpretation: 

Your p-value is less than the alpha value, and therefore, this test would be considered statistically significant.
