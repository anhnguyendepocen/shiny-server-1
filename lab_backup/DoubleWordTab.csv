Information,Variable,Label 
,Cue Word,"The first word in a word pairing.  For semantic variables, the order of pairings is not important.  For the association variables, this value represents the first word given to participants in a free association task."
,Target Word,"The second word in a word pairing.  For associative variables, this word represents the first word that ""came to mind when shown the cue word"""
Semantic,Root Cosine,"The feature overlap between two words calculated on root words only.  This value ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 values indicate no overlap between words and 1 values indicate complete overlap between words."
Semantic,Raw Cosine,"The feature overlap between two words calculated on raw, unfixed words only.  This value ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 values indicate no overlap between words and 1 values indicate complete overlap between words"
Semantic,Affix Cosine,"The feature overlap between two words calculated on affix overlap.  This value ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 values indicate no overlap between words and 1 values indicate complete overlap between words."
Semantic,Old Cosine,"The feature overlap between two words calculated on overlap from Buchanan et al. (2012).  This value ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 values indicate no overlap between words and 1 values indicate complete overlap between words."
Semantic,JCN,"The dictionary distance between words.  Using WordNet, Maki et al. (2004) have calculated the relationship between word pairs.  This variable ranges from 0 to 32 and is reverse coded so that 0 values have a very high semantic relationship."
Semantic,LSA,Latent Semantic Analysis shows both the semantic and thematic relationship between word pairs.  Low values are close to 0 and high values are close to 1.
Associative,FSG,Forward strength is the probability of the target word association when shown the cue word (ranges from 0 to 1).
Associative,BSG,Backward strength is the probability of the cue word association when shown the target word (ranges from 0 to 1).
