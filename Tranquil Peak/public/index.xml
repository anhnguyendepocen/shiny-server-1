      <description>The effect size is a measure of the magnitude of the effect. How much did grades improve after an intervention? To what degree were symptoms reduced after a treatment? Effect size supplements p-values by providing this critical information. The MOTE package provides researchers with a streamlined tool to calculate effect size and interpret test statistics.</description>
