      <description>The effect size is a measure of the magnitude of the effect. How much did grades improve after an intervention? To what degree were symptoms reduced after a treatment? Effect size supplements p-values by providing this critical information. The MOTE package provides researchers with a streamlined tool to calculate effect size and interpret test statistics.</description>

      <title>Why Report Effect Size?</title>

      <description>Effect sizes broadly fall into two categories:
1) Mean differences: normally represented by *Z* or *d*, usually the standardized difference between two means. 2) Variance overlap: normally representated by eta/omega, r-squared, or V, usually the amount of variance in the DV accounted for by the IV(s).  Overall, we can think about effect sizes as a measure of the magnitude of an phenomenon. Unlike p-values, effect size is not as confounded by sample size.</description>
