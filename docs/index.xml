      <description>Description This function displays d for repeated measures data and the non-central confidence interval using the average standard deviation of each level as the denominator.
The formula for d is: $$d = \frac{M_1 - M_2}{\frac{SD_1 + SD_2}{2}}$$
R Function d.dep.t.avg(m1, m2, sd1, sd2, n, a = 0.05)
Arguments  m1 = mean from first level m2 = mean from second level sd1 = standard deviation from first level sd2 = standard deviation from second level n = sample size a = significance level  Example In a study to test the effects of science fiction movies on people&amp;rsquo;s belief in the supernatural, seven people completed a measure of belief in the supernatural before and after watching a popular science fiction movie.</description>

      <guid>https://www.aggieerin.com/shiny-server/meandifferences/ztestz.html</guid>
      <description>Description This function displays d for z-scores when all you have is the z-statistics. The normoal confidence interval is also provided if you have sigma. If sigma is left blank, then you will not see a confidence interval.
The formula for d is: $$d = \frac{Z}{\sqrt(N)}$$
The formula for Z is: $$Z = \frac{M - \mu}{\sigma_M}$$
R Function d.z.z(z, sig = NA, n, a = 0.05)
Arguments  z = statistic sig = population standard deviation n = sample size a = significance level  Example A recent study suggested that students (N = 100) learning statistics improved their test scores with the use of visual aids (Z = 2.</description>

      <description>Effect sizes broadly fall into two categories:
1) Mean differences: normally represented by Z or d, usually the standardized difference between two means.
2) Variance overlap: normally representated by eta/omega, r-squared, or V, usually the amount of variance in the DV accounted for by the IV(s).
Overall, we can think about effect sizes as a measure of the magnitude of an phenomenon. Unlike p-values, effect size is not as confounded by sample size.</description>
