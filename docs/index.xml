      <description>Description This function displays d and non-central confidence interval for single t estimated from the t-statistic.
The formula for d is: $$d = \frac{t}{\sqrt(N)}$$
The formula for t is: $$t = \frac{M - \mu}{SE}$$
R Function d.single.t.t(t, n, a = 0.05)
Arguments  t = t-test value n = sample size a = significance level  Example A school has a gifted/honors program that they claim is significantly better than others in the country.</description>

      <guid>https://www.aggieerin.com/shiny-server/meandifferences/ztestmeans.html</guid>
      <description>Description This function displays d for z-scores with the population mean and standard deviation. The normal confidence interval is also provided.
The formula for d is: $$d = \frac{M - \mu}{\sigma}$$
The formula for Z is: $$Z = \frac{M - \mu}{\sigma_M}$$
R Function d.z.mean(mu, m1, sig, sd1, n, a = 0.05)
Arguments  mu = population mean
 m1 = sample study mean
 sig = population standard deviation</description>

      <title>General Overview</title>

      <description>The effect size is a measure of the magnitude of the effect. How much did grades improve after an intervention? To what degree were symptoms reduced after a treatment? Effect size supplements p-values by providing this critical information. The MOTE package provides researchers with a streamlined tool to calculate effect size and interpret test statistics.</description>

      <title>Why Report Effect Size?</title>

      <description>Effect sizes broadly fall into two categories:
1) Mean differences: normally represented by *Z* or *d*, usually the standardized difference between two means. 2) Variance overlap: normally representated by eta/omega, r-squared, or V, usually the amount of variance in the DV accounted for by the IV(s).  Overall, we can think about effect sizes as a measure of the magnitude of an phenomenon. Unlike p-values, effect size is not as confounded by sample size.</description>
