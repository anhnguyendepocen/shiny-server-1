The formula for *V* is: $$\sqrt{ \frac{\chi^2} {N \times df_{smaller}} } $$

$df_{smaller}$ is defined by the minimum of (rows - 1) or (columns - 1). 

The code to use MOTE in R is: 
 
```{r help, echo=FALSE, include = FALSE}
source("output_functions.R")
library(knitr)
library(MOTE)
saved = help_console(v.chi.sq, "html", before = "", after = "")
```
 
`r paste(saved[-c(1:8)], collapse = " ")`
