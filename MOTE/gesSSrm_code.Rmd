The formula for $\eta_G^2$ is: $$\frac{SS_{model}}{SS_{model} + SS_{subject} + SS_{errorA} + SS_{errorB} + SS_{errorAxB}}$$

The labels A and B here indicate the two IVs in a two-way design. AxB indicates the interaction term for A by B. This formula does not cover more than two-way designs.

The code to use MOTE in R is: 
 
```{r help, echo=FALSE, include = FALSE}
source("output_functions.R")
library(knitr)
library(MOTE)
saved = help_console(ges.partial.SS.rm, "html", before = "", after = "")
```
 
`r paste(saved[-c(1:8)], collapse = " ")`
