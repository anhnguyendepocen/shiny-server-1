The formula for $\eta^2$ is: $$\frac{df_{model} \times F_{model}} {df_{model} \times F_{model} + df_{error}}$$

This value will be $\eta^2$ when you use a one-way ANOVA and will be $\eta_p^2$ when you use a multi-way ANOVA (more than one IV).

The code to use MOTE in R is: 
 
```{r help, echo=FALSE, include = FALSE}
source("output_functions.R")
library(knitr)
library(MOTE)
saved = help_console(eta.F, "html", before = "", after = "")
```
 
`r paste(saved[-c(1:8)], collapse = " ")`
