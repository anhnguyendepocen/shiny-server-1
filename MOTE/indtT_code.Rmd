The formula for d is: $$d = 2*\frac{t}{\sqrt{N_1 + N_2 - 2}}$$
 
The formula for t is: $$t = \frac{M_1 - M_2}{SE}$$
 
The code to use MOTE in R is: 
 
```{r help, echo=FALSE, include = FALSE}
source("output_functions.R")
library(knitr)
library(MOTE)
saved = help_console(d.ind.t.t, "html", before = "", after = "")
```
 
`r paste(saved[-c(1:8)], collapse = " ")`
