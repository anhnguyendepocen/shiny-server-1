The formula for *t* is: $$t = \frac{r}{\sqrt{1-(r^2)^2/(n -2)}}$$

The formula for *F* is: $$\frac{MS_{model}}{MS_{error}}$$

The code to use MOTE in R is: 
 
```{r help, echo=FALSE, include = FALSE}
source("output_functions.R")
library(knitr)
library(MOTE)
saved = help_console(r.correl, "html", before = "", after = "")
```
 
`r paste(saved[-c(1:8)], collapse = " ")`
