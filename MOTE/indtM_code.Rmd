The formula for d is: $$d_{s} = \frac{M_1 - M_2}{SD_{pooled}}$$
 
The formula for t is: $$t = \frac{M_1 - M_2}{SE_{pooled}}$$
 
The code to use MOTE in R is: 
 
```{r help, echo=FALSE, include = FALSE}
source("output_functions.R")
library(knitr)
library(MOTE)
saved = help_console(d.ind.t, "html", before = "", after = "")
```
 
`r paste(saved[-c(1:8)], collapse = " ")`
