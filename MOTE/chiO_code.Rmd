The formula for *odds* is: $$\frac{(N_{11}/N_{12})}{(N_{21}/N_{22})}$$

The code to use MOTE in R is: 
 
```{r help, echo=FALSE, include = FALSE}
source("output_functions.R")
library(knitr)
library(MOTE)
saved = help_console(odds, "html", before = "", after = "")
```
 
`r paste(saved[-c(1:8)], collapse = " ")`
