The formula for $\omega_G^2$ is: $$\frac{SS_{modelA} - (df_{modelA} \times MS_{subjectA})} 
{SS_{total} + SS_{modelB} + J_B \times MS_{subjectA}}$$

Note: A is the target IV to calculate generalized omega squared on. B is the other IV. J is the number of levels for IV B. 

The code to use MOTE in R is: 
 
```{r help, echo=FALSE, include = FALSE}
source("output_functions.R")
library(knitr)
library(MOTE)
saved = help_console(omega.gen.SS.rm, "html", before = "", after = "")
```
 
`r paste(saved[-c(1:8)], collapse = " ")`
