The formula for d is: $$d_{rm} = \frac{M_1 - M_2}{\sqrt{(SD_1^2 + SD_2^2)  - (2 \times r \times SD_1 \times SD_2)}} \times \sqrt{2 \times (1-r)}$$
 
The t-test is not given in this example, as you do not have the information needed to calculate it. 
 
The code to use MOTE in R is: 
 
```{r help, echo=FALSE, include = FALSE}
source("output_functions.R")
library(knitr)
library(MOTE)
saved = help_console(d.dep.t.rm, "html", before = "", after = "")
```
 
`r paste(saved[-c(1:8)], collapse = " ")`
